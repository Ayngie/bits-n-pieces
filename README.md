# Bits n' pieces 
React + TypeScript + Vite


## Overview:
Bits n' pieces. Stuff. 
Buttons, counters, inputs, forms...
Just playing around with some components and tags... :)


N.B. This app has NO focus on styling!! 
Some basic styling is included purely for the purpose of marking different components.
